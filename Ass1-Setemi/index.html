    <h3>My Tech Journey</h3>

    <p>I can't' start this story without touching my childhood,since my early years i have always found myself around catching fun from knowing how things work and how they came to be, from my toys, to the boiling rings and then trasistor radio -and the tv-set(mostly when it actually starts the faults first, before i add more).This like to know more attitude neever left me during my formal education phase infact it grew more..then came my love for the internet and how it works. My first step in Tech started sometime after 2020, after my a friend of mine who had travelled to the US had issues with work and chose a new career phase in tech, i saw how it easy it was for him to switch to something i would say i also admire, this made me as questions and joined him in the studies except that i was self schooling myself, it was a rough one and without form until i heard about AltSchoolafrica. It all dawned on me like the sun-ray from my window that MY TIME AS COME. And since then i have been filled with the believe that my tech Dream Would come Alive here and i would live it with Joy and thanks for all the sweat put into it. AltSchool inspires and i think  you should experience this too. <a href="https://altschoolafrican.com/">join</a> </p>
